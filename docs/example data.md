Question: What do you hope to gain from this 3-week program

Answer: I want a calmer mind and a few grounding techniques I can use when school feels overwhelming. I’d like to feel more confident settling into this new city and routine.

Question: What led you to consider counseling at this time in your life?

Answer: I moved for grad school a few months ago and it’s been lonelier than I expected. I notice I’m more anxious and I put off big tasks. I want support while I figure out a better rhythm.

Question: What are the main challenges or struggles you’re facing right now?

Answer: Feeling isolated, comparing myself to classmates, and procrastinating on readings and papers. I also stay up late scrolling, which makes mornings harder.

Question: Is there anything important you’d like your therapist to know about you before sessions begin?

Answer: I prefer practical steps over theory. Small, clear exercises help me get started. I’m open to trying new routines as long as they fit a busy schedule.

Milestone specific outcome reports:

Markdown outcome
Date: Week 1
Focus: Orientation, isolation, study anxiety

Therapist Notes:

Priya described moving for grad school and feeling disconnected.

Noted nighttime scrolling and late sleep as anxiety avoidance.

Introduced a 2-part routine: (1) Grounding micro-break (60-second paced breathing) before study blocks; (2) 30–5 study timer (30 minutes focused, 5 minutes off).

Normalized adjustment period; discussed a low-stakes social touchpoint each week (e.g., after-seminar coffee).

Plan:

Use the 30–5 timer for two study blocks per day.

60-second paced breathing before each block.

Schedule one social micro-connection this week (message a classmate to compare notes).

Participant reflection: The timer felt doable. I got through an article without bouncing between tabs. I messaged someone from my cohort and we set a time to review notes next week. I still scrolled late two nights, but it felt more like a choice than a spiral.

Markdown outcome
Date: Week 2
Focus: Sleep hygiene, comparison thinking, routine building

Therapist Notes:

Priya completed at least one 30–5 block most days; two blocks on three days.

Reported one successful coffee chat; felt “less invisible.”

Identified comparison thoughts (“Everyone else has it together”).

Introduced a thought label (“That’s a comparison story”) + 1 small action (open the doc, read 1 paragraph).

Sleep: created a 10:45 pm lights-out target, phone charging outside bedroom.

Plan:

Maintain daily 30–5 blocks (aim 2/day on weekdays).

Use comparison label → 1 small action when stuck.

Lights out 10:45 pm, phone outside room 4 nights this week.

Participant reflection: Naming the ‘comparison story’ helped. I opened the doc even when I didn’t feel like it. I hit the 10:45 target three nights and woke up less groggy. The coffee chat was nice—we made a plan to study again.

Program Overview

Program: CalmPath — 3-Week Online Counseling
Therapist: [Name Redacted]
Duration: 3 sessions (1 hour per week, via Zoom)
Participant: Priya Kapoor

Attendance & Engagement

Attended all 3 sessions on time.

Completed weekly reflections and tried each assigned exercise.

Built consistency with study blocks and sleep routine.

Key Themes

Adjustment Stress & Isolation: Move for grad school led to loneliness and anxiety.

Procrastination & Avoidance: Nighttime scrolling and academic avoidance increased stress.

Comparison Thinking: “Everyone else has it together” fed self-doubt.

Structure Helps: Priya responds well to clear, small steps and accountability.

Progress & Growth

Study Routine: Implemented 30–5 focus blocks most days; achieved two blocks on multiple weekdays.

Sleep: Shifted to ~10:45–11:00 pm lights-out several nights/week; less morning fatigue.

Social Connection: Initiated two study meetups and one coffee chat; reported feeling less isolated.

Cognitive Skills: Labeled comparison thoughts and pivoted to one small action; added a brief self-encouragement script.

Therapist Observations

Priya is practical, thoughtful, and consistent once routines are clear.

Energy and confidence improved across sessions; affect moved from tense/anxious → steady/hopeful.

Benefits most from bite-sized actions with visible wins (e.g., one paragraph, one block, one message).

Recommendations

Maintain two 30–5 study blocks on weekdays; add a third when feasible before deadlines.

Sustain sleep routine (10:45 pm lights-out, phone charging outside the bedroom).

Plan 2–3 social touchpoints weekly (study partner, campus group, professor office hours).

Keep the thought label → action step workflow for comparison spirals.

Optional follow-up: Monthly check-in for accountability during midterms/finals.
